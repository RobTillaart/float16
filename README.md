# float16

Arduino library to implement float16 data type.


## Description

This **experimental** library defines the float16 (2 byte) data type, including conversion
function to and from float32 type. It is definitely **work in progress**.

The library implements the **Printable** interface so one can directly print the
float16 values in any stream e.g. Serial.

The primary usage of the float16 data type is to efficiently store and transport
a floating point number. As it uses only 2 bytes where float and double have typical
4 and 8 bytes, gains can be made at the price of range and precision.


#### Breaking change 0.2.0

Version 0.2.0 has a breaking change as a conversion bug has been found.
See for details in issue #10.
For some specific values the mantissa overflowed when the float 16 was 
assigned a value to. This overflow was not detected / corrected.

During the analysis of this bug it became clear that the sub-normal numbers 
were also implemented correctly. This is fixed too in 0.2.0.

There is still an issue 0 versus -0

**This makes all pre-0.2.0 version obsolete.**

#### Example values

Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-precision_floating-point_format

```cpp
/*
   SIGN  EXP     MANTISSA
    0    01111    0000000000 = 1
    0    01111    0000000001 = 1 + 2−10 = 1.0009765625 (next smallest float after 1)
    1    10000    0000000000 = −2

    0    11110    1111111111 = 65504  (max half precision)

    0    00001    0000000000 = 2−14 ≈ 6.10352 × 10−5 (minimum positive normal)
    0    00000    1111111111 = 2−14 - 2−24 ≈ 6.09756 × 10−5 (maximum subnormal)
    0    00000    0000000001 = 2−24 ≈ 5.96046 × 10−8 (minimum positive subnormal)

    0    00000    0000000000 = 0
    1    00000    0000000000 = −0

    0    11111    0000000000 = infinity
    1    11111    0000000000 = −infinity

    0    01101    0101010101 = 0.333251953125 ≈ 1/3

## Interface

```cpp
#include "float16.h"
```

#### Constructors

- **float16(void)** defaults to zero.
- **float16(double f)** constructor.
- **float16(const float16 &f)** copy constructor.


#### Conversion

- **double toDouble(void)** convert to double (or float).
- **uint16_t getBinary()** get the 2 byte binary representation.
- **void setBinary(uint16_t u)** set the 2 bytes binary representation.
- **size_t printTo(Print& p) const** Printable interface.
- **void setDecimals(uint8_t d)** idem, used for printTo.
- **uint8_t getDecimals()** idem.

Note the setDecimals takes one byte per object which is not efficient for arrays of float16.
See array example for efficient storage using set/getBinary() functions.


#### Compare

Standard compare functions. Since 0.1.5 these are quite optimized,
so it is fast to compare e.g. 2 measurements.

- **bool operator == (const float16& f)**
- **bool operator != (const float16& f)**
- **bool operator >  (const float16& f)**
- **bool operator >= (const float16& f)**
- **bool operator <  (const float16& f)**
- **bool operator <= (const float16& f)**


#### Math (basic)

Math is done by converting to double, do the math and convert back.
These operators are added for convenience only.
Not planned to optimize these.

- **float16 operator + (const float16& f)**
- **float16 operator - (const float16& f)**
- **float16 operator \* (const float16& f)**
- **float16 operator / (const float16& f)**
- **float16& operator += (const float16& f)**
- **float16& operator -= (const float16& f)**
- **float16& operator \*= (const float16& f)**
- **float16& operator /= (const float16& f)**

negation operator.
- **float16 operator - ()** fast negation.

- **int sign()** returns 1 == positive, 0 == zero,  -1 == negative.
- **bool isZero()** returns true if zero. slightly faster than **sign()**.
- **bool isInf()** returns true if value is (-)infinite.


#### Experimental 0.1.8

- **bool isNaN()** returns true if value is not a number.


## Notes


## Future

#### Must

- update documentation.

#### Should

- unit tests of the above.
- how to handle 0 == -0  (0x0000 == 0x8000)
- investigate ARM alternative half-precision
_ARM processors support (via a floating point control register bit) 
an "alternative half-precision" format, which does away with the 
special case for an exponent value of 31 (111112).[10] It is almost 
identical to the IEEE format, but there is no encoding for infinity or NaNs; 
instead, an exponent of 31 encodes normalized numbers in the range 65536 to 131008._


#### Could

- update documentation.
- error handling.
  - divide by zero errors.
- look for optimizations.
- rewrite **f16tof32()** with bit magic.
- add storage example - with SD card, FRAM or EEPROM
- add communication example - serial or Ethernet?
